# âš¡ Futures Arbitrage Scanner

A high-performance, real-time cryptocurrency futures arbitrage scanner that connects to multiple exchanges simultaneously to identify profitable trading opportunities across different platforms.

## Why Arbitrage Scanning Matters

In cryptocurrency markets, price discrepancies between exchanges create profitable arbitrage opportunities. This tool focuses on:

1. **Real-Time Price Monitoring**: Streams live price data from multiple major exchanges (Binance, Bybit, Hyperliquid, Kraken, OKX, Gate.io) to detect price differences instantly.

2. **Arbitrage Opportunity Detection**: Identifies profitable opportunities where you can buy on one exchange and sell on another for a guaranteed profit, accounting for fees and slippage.

3. **Spread Analysis**: Provides a comprehensive spread matrix showing price differences between all exchange pairs, helping traders understand market dynamics.

This tool provides the foundational data for developing sophisticated arbitrage trading strategies in the fast-moving cryptocurrency futures markets.

## Architecture

### Go Backend

- **WebSocket Broadcasting**: Efficient real-time data distribution to all connected clients
- **Scalable Design**: Easy addition of new exchanges and trading pairs

### Frontend

Single-page application built with vanilla JavaScript for maximum performance:

- **uPlot Charting**: Fast, memory-efficient real-time price visualization
- **WebSocket Client**: Persistent connection for live data streaming
- **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time UI updates as new data arrives
- **Professional Interface**: Clean, data-focused design optimized for traders

## Quick Start

1. **Run the backend server**:
